## Final AI Rules & Deployment Guidelines

### Production Deployment Checklist

#### Pre-Deployment Security Audit
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All sensitive keys moved to secure storage
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Verify all endpoints use HTTPS
- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Check bundle size with Metro bundler
- [ ] **Code Obfuscation**: Enable code obfuscation for production builds
- [ ] **Certificate Pinning**: Implement SSL certificate pinning
- [ ] **Root Detection**: Add root/jailbreak detection for security

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Keep under 50MB for App Store compliance
- [ ] **Startup Time**: Target <3 seconds cold start
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- [ ] **Battery Usage**: Optimize location services and background tasks
- [ ] **Network Efficiency**: Implement request caching and compression

#### App Store Compliance
- [ ] **Privacy Policy**: Create comprehensive privacy policy
- [ ] **Terms of Service**: Update terms for user data handling
- [ ] **Content Guidelines**: Ensure no prohibited content
- [ ] **Age Rating**: Set appropriate age rating (12+ for fire alerts)
- [ ] **Metadata**: Complete app store listing with screenshots

#### Monitoring Setup
```typescript
// Error tracking configuration
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  environment: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  beforeSend: (event) => {
    // Filter out sensitive data
    delete event.user?.email;
    return event;
  }
});
```

### Emergency Response Procedures

#### Critical Bug Response
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine severity and user impact
2. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare immediate rollback to previous stable version
3. **Hotfix Deployment**: Deploy critical fixes via CodePush or store update
4. **Communication**: Notify users via in-app notifications
5. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned

#### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable affected features
2. **User Notification**: Alert users if data potentially compromised
3. **Investigation**: Conduct thorough security audit
4. **Fix Deployment**: Deploy security patches immediately
5. **Transparency Report**: Publish incident report if needed

### Maintenance Schedule

#### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Monitor crash reports and error logs
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

#### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Security vulnerability scan
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] User feedback analysis
- [ ] Feature usage analytics review

#### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Dependency major version updates
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing

### Legal & Compliance

#### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user data
- **Right to Deletion**: Implement user data deletion endpoint
- **Data Portability**: Allow users to export their data
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in for data collection
- **Privacy by Design**: Build privacy into all features

#### COPPA Compliance (if targeting users under 13)
- **Age Verification**: Implement age gate for users under 13
- **Parental Consent**: Require parental consent for minors
- **Limited Data Collection**: Restrict data collection for children

### Continuous Integration Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy FireAlert App
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Expo
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          expo-version: latest
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
      - run: eas build --platform all --non-interactive
```

### Final Deployment Commands

#### iOS App Store
```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform ios

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

#### Google Play Store
```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform android

# Submit to Play Store
eas submit --platform android
```

### Post-Launch Monitoring

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**
- **Crash Rate** (target <1%)
- **Average Session Duration**
- **Feature Adoption Rate**
- **User Retention (7-day, 30-day)**
- **API Response Times**
- **Error Rate by Endpoint**

#### Alert Thresholds
- **Crash Rate**: >0.5% triggers immediate investigation
- **API Errors**: >5% error rate triggers alert
- **Performance**: >3s response time triggers optimization
- **User Complaints**: >10 similar complaints triggers review
